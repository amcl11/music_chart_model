    "## Function: `get_track_position_in_playlist`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to find the position of a specific track within a Spotify playlist. It requires the Spotify API credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`), a `playlist_id`, and a `track_id` to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `client_id`: Your Spotify application's client ID.\n",
    "- `client_secret`: Your Spotify application's client secret.\n",
    "- `redirect_uri`: The redirect URI set in your Spotify application.\n",
    "- `playlist_id`: The Spotify ID of the playlist in which you want to find the track's position.\n",
    "- `track_id`: The Spotify ID of the track whose position you're looking for in the playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The function begins by setting the necessary permission scope, `playlist-read-private`, to access private playlist data. It then initializes the Spotify client with the provided credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetching Playlist Tracks**: Using the Spotify client, the function retrieves the tracks from the specified playlist. It keeps track of the current index (position) starting from `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterating Through Tracks**: It loops through each track in the playlist:\n",
    "   - If the current track is not `None` (indicating a valid track object), it compares the track's ID with the `track_id` parameter.\n",
    "   - If a match is found, the function returns the current position (index) of the track within the playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pagination Handling**: Spotify paginates long lists of tracks. If the end of a page is reached, the function automatically fetches the next page and continues the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result**: \n",
    "   - If the track is found, it returns the `position` (zero-based index) of the track in the playlist.\n",
    "   - If the track is not found after searching through all pages, it returns `-1`."
