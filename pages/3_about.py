    This site aims to streamline Friday morning playlist checking for those interested in New Release coverage as well as historical coverage. 
    
    Not every new release is tracked... the list of new releases solely focuses on songs that were added to 
    
    *New Music Friday AU & NZ*. 
    
    It then uses this group of songs to check if they were also added to other key AU editorial playlists and also what positions they recieved.  
    
    *Note:* The historical coverage cut off is Wednesday after the previous Friday release. This gives tracks a chance to be added to larger playlists like Top 50 / Hot Hits Australia. That means, historical data is a snapshot of coverage between release day and the following Wednesday 9am.
