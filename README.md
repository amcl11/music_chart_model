# Streamlit app - Spotify New Release(AU) Dashboard

A dashboard that pulls all new songs added to New Music Friday AU & NZ from the Spotify API.

The songs are then checked against the main AU Spotify ecosystem playlists to check if they picked up additonal playlist adds, and what position they were added to. 

Some additonal global and non-Spotify owned palylists all also checked such as triple j's New Music Hit List, Singled Out, and Today's Top Hits.
